		<div>For me, food is a universe of endless possibilities. All you need are a few natural ingredients that, when combined correctly, result in delicious creations. My recipes have always been characterized by extremely simple and natural lists of ingredients, a little different from typical star chefs. So my creations are suitable for every day, even if it has to be quick. A healthy diet should definitely not only be on the weekends.</div><br>
		<div>I thought to myself that what works in cooking must also work in the production of food. Above all, I asked myself why some Herzens products just don't come in "clean". So I decided: I'll try that myself. Together with a small team, we worked on it for over a year and tried a lot.</div></div>

		<div>Starting signal in my own kitchen. I weighed every ingredient to the gram, counted every minute in the oven, photographed every step and sent it to factories. "Can you implement it exactly like this?" - the answer was mostly "no". Sometimes there was a problem with the machines, sometimes with the raw materials I wanted and sometimes simply with the willingness to try something new. Cane sugar and plastic wrap were the biggest obstacles in the way. If you want to avoid these 2 components, you can say goodbye to 90% of the producers. But if you search long, you will find.</div>
